# Bisection Method in C

## Overview

This program implements the **Bisection Method** to find the root of a nonlinear equation using the C programming language. The Bisection Method is an iterative numerical technique used to find the roots of a continuous function, `f(x)`, within a given interval `[a, b]`.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter two initial guesses (`a` and `b`) that bracket the root of the function.
- Continuously refines the interval using the Bisection Method until the error is within the specified tolerance (`err`).
- Outputs the intermediate steps, values of `a` and `b`, midpoint `c`, and the value of `f(c)` at each step.
- Prints the root of the function once it converges.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Basic understanding of numerical methods and the Bisection Method.

## How to Run

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the C code provided in the `bisection.c` file.
2. **Compile the Code**: Use a C compiler to compile the file.
    ```bash
    gcc bisection.c -o bisection -lm
    ```
    Note: The `-lm` flag is used to link the math library (`math.h`).
3. **Execute the Program**:
    ```bash
    ./bisection
    ```

## Inputs

- The user needs to enter two initial guesses, `a` and `b`, such that `f(a)` and `f(b)` have opposite signs (i.e., the root is between `a` and `b`).
- The user also provides the desired error tolerance (`err`).

## Code Explanation

- **Header Files**: The code includes `stdio.h` for standard input/output functions and `math.h` for mathematical operations.
- **Macro Definition**: `f(x)` is defined as the function whose root needs to be found: 
  ```c
  #define f(x) 3*x+sin(x)-exp(x)
  ```
- **Main Function**:
  - Prompts the user to input two initial roots `a` and `b`.
  - Computes `f(a)` and `f(b)` and checks if they have opposite signs. If not, the program asks for new values.
  - Uses the Bisection Method to iteratively find the root.
  - Outputs each step, the values of `a`, `b`, the midpoint `c`, and `f(c)`.
  - Prints the final root when the absolute value of `f(c)` is less than the specified error (`err`).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors during compilation or execution, consider the following:

1. Ensure that you have linked the math library using the `-lm` flag.
2. Verify that your initial guesses `a` and `b` satisfy the condition `f(a) * f(b) < 0`. This ensures that there is a root in the interval `[a, b]`.

## Sample Output

```
Enter the 2 roots of a function
-1
0
Enter the error tolerance: 
0.0001

Steps          a              b              c              f(c)

1       -1.000000     0.000000      -0.500000      -1.357008
2       -0.500000     0.000000      -0.250000      -0.139635
3       -0.250000     0.000000      -0.125000      0.269705
...

Root -> -0.201171
```

## Limitations

- The initial guesses `a` and `b` must bracket the root.
- The function must be continuous in the interval `[a, b]`.
- Convergence is guaranteed only if the function satisfies the above conditions.

## Future Improvements

- Allow the user to input different functions dynamically.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add options to visualize the function and its root graphically.
